## Research Questions 

1. What is Git? Git is a version Control System
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version 
controla system that allows you to magange code history. Github is a host 
service that allows you to manage repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? It allows you to work on your specfic 
changes independent from the main branch. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? It pull your changes into github 
allowing others to see and review the changes you have made.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 
In this case you would use git checkout main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 
Git fetch downloads your repository changes.
Git pull downloads and merges them to the branch being worked on
Git merge marges forks into 1 branch
7. What is a merge conflict? It is when changes are made to the same file. Example 2 people are editing but making completely different edits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? First you need to locate the errors. Git status can show this. Then headover to the files and either delete 1 or the 
other or make the correct changes to ensure both files line up the same.
